        Prototyping the camera device was a matter of finding the most advanced solutions that the modern hardware
        industry has to offer. We went through a long trial and error process, constantly updating our plans and
        trying out yet better alternatives in each iteration. The early test prototypes were engineered using a
        module-based system:
      
        </p>
         
        <div
          class="m-48_bottom"
          data-aos="fade-up"
          data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom"
        >
          <div
            class="lottie-container case_lottie"
            id="prototype"
            style="--height: 395px; --width: 100%;"
          />
        </div>
         
        <p
          class="case_paragraph p-96_bottom media-p-48_bottom case_section-paragraph-grey"
        >
          
        Low efficiency of power supply was a major challenge that we needed to focus on and overcome. The device’s
        initial version featured double conversion of energy where linear regulators first converted energy from power
        banks (+5 V) to make it fit for charging the Li+ accumulator (3.7 V–4.2 V), and then energy went back up to 5
        V to power the periphery of the device. Conversion was carried out by a pulsed DC/DC converter with a large
        output ripple value, so the operation of the controller and the periphery of the device was unstable.
