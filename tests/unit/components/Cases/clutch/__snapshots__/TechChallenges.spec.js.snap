      Clutch’s customer base and website traffic are doubling every year. With great growth come great technical
      challenges. The stable solution that worked smoothly for a small user base was no longer enough to sustain the
      website traffic of 800K unique users per month. The slow, monolithic architecture had become an obstacle to
      growth.

      So, to continue improving the way that companies look for vendors, Clutch decided to bring changes to the current
      technological stack and then build a faster, better platform with new software architecture.
