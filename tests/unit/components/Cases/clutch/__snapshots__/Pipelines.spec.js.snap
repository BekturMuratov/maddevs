      Code of exceptional quality has been our primary goal in our work with Clutch.co. By meticulously testing each
      code element with unit, acceptance, and screen compare tests and by applying present-day approaches to
      development and deployment, we have provided exceptional flexibility in our delivery of a stable Clutch.co
      solution. To avoid downtimes and issues caused by new deployments, testing and staging environments in
      Kubernetes perfectly mimic production. Thus, all updates are made without any inconvenience to the end users.

      A business always strives to effectively use their employeesâ€™ time and skills, even when they are 12 hours away.
