      Mad Devs engineers have developed Clutch.co’s Statistics microservice that gathers data for the internal and
      external intelligent decision-making process. Three million rows of data are stored in PostgreSQL.

      The Clutch algorithm continuously updates companies’ positions within different categories’ pages, directories,
      leader matrices, etc. The Statistics service collects such data to provide companies with a broader picture of
      their performance in comparison with their competitors.

      Clicks and views come from various Clutch pages. Companies can determine in which categories they are more
      popular and have a competitive advantage.

      This data is used inside another SPM microservice. Sponsorship, in turn, is a microservice that enables Clutch’s revenue
      operator managers to control sponsored accounts and deliver the value of sponsored accounts to paid customers.

      Geographical data repository

      Essentially, the geographical database repository we developed is an interface for managing and editing data.
      Due to the lack of cost-effective solutions, Mad Devs engineers have decided to optimise expenses by developing
      the service from scratch.
    
      </p>
       
      <p
        class="case_paragraph m-48_bottom media-m-24_bottom"

      The service gathers data like regions, cities, states/provinces, and postal codes from a user-editable
      geographical database. However, the extensive amount of data was filtered from 7M place names to 52K. Special
      scripts automatically update the database to keep it up to date.
