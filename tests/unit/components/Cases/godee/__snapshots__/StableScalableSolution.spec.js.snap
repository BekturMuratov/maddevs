    Transportation and logistics software has zero tolerance to downtime. Imagine hundreds of passengers not
    being able to book their tickets, drivers not knowing where to pick up/drop off passengers or operators
    seeing empty screens.

    GoDee’s microservice architecture and the quality of the solution make it easy for each Mad Devs developer
    to deploy new features without causing spikes in downtime. On top of this, 75% of code is covered by various
    tests and has detailed documentation and pull requests. GoDee's business model greatly benefits from
    economies of scale. Thus, increased demand from Ho Chi Minh citizens is backed up by GoDee's unchanging low
    cost for infrastructure.

    GoDee faced the challenge of changing people’s habits. To grow the user base, we needed to create an
    extremely helpful and hassle-free solution that offers an alternative to expensive taxis and inconvenient
    motorbikes. It was also key that it be predictable, affordable and ‘green’ by design.
