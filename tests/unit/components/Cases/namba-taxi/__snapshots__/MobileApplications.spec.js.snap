      We developed mobile applications that can handle the full range of functions a taxi service needs. Passengers,
      drivers, and operators interact through a thoroughly automated environment. Passengers order a cab with just a
      few taps, drivers can accept orders within seconds, and all journeys can be tracked in real time.

      Ariadna: Data geocoder

      Ariadna is an in-house developed, open-source geocoder based on ElasticSearch that uses OpenStreetMap. The tool
      searches for coordinates using the names of places and synonyms. It can find crossroads and addresses within a
      certain radius. It does reverse geocoding and updates automatically as it receives new data from drivers.

      One of the most challenging things in the project was to enable human-friendly search on the map. Ariadna was a
      unique solution that handled the task.

      The result was a complex yet reliable system. It features six roles (Operator, Passenger, Partner, Driver,
      Manager, and Corporate Client), and hereâ€™s how interactions among apps and third-party software go:
