    Automation of the driver-passenger interactions is what Namba Taxi decided to pursue. Mad Devs’ mission is to
    automate as many interactions as possible: we want to let machines do everything that they can do better than
    humans. Namba Taxi wanted an automated, next-generation, Uber-like transportation solution. We undertook the
    challenge of developing this software. We undertook the challenge of developing this software and started in 2013.

          description="Namba Taxi was one of the first companies in Central Asia to join the sharing economy. If calling a cab is simple enough, people will prefer it to owning a car. This creates a city with fewer cars and a more efficient distribution of resources, making urban development more sustainable."
