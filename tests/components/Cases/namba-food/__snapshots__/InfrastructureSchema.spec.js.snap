      A local hosting provider is used to host the infrastructure. When a system receives a request from the client,
      it is handled by the Nginx proxy. When the Mad Devs team deploys a new version, we use the Nginx Gen server. The
      Nginx proxy sends requests to the website, which is in turn connected to the MySQL database, and Redis serves as
      an in-memory key-value storage.

      All our services run in Docker containers, which simplifies the process of infrastructure maintenance and
      monitoring.
