    The role of DevOps specialists is to bring order and predictability to the development process: remove bottlenecks, simplify delivery, and automate as many processes as possible. The goal is to turn the development of features into a smoothly running conveyor belt.

      Dockerization is the most viable solution today to set up continuous delivery. As our application was back then partially hosted on Heroku, we created a unified runtime for developers and CI by dockerizing the main app using a Heroku Stack image and Docker Compose. It made CI reliable and allowed simplifying deployment. Also, it sped up bootstrapping of the development environment.

    Jenkins was operated manually on a separate EC2 instance. Managing it was thus challenging, especially in emergencies. We moved the Jenkins master to ECS by remaking its provisioning, deployment, and updating (Later, we’ll move it to k8s, but in 2017, ECS was the only good option for us). We reduced build time and cost by allocating a small part of compute resources of Jenkins agents to reserved instances and moving 90% of the load to spot instances.

    Phase 4: Cutting the costs

    Cutting the costs for the customer is not about making compromises but about achieving efficiency. The mind of a DevOps engineer is like an hourglass: engineers are focusing on either improving performance or cutting the costs. It’s flipping all the time, and it is needed to find balance, which is solutions that are effective and cheap.
  
      </p>
       
      <p
        class="case_paragraph m-48_bottom media-m-24_bottom"
      >
        
    Once we improved Veeqo’s performance and user experience, we started working on optimizing infrastructure costs. In total, the infrastructure used to cost the customer about 
        <span
          class="case_red-text"
        >
          ~$20,000 per month.
        </span>
         Within one summer, as we prepared the new solutions and migrated to them, we brought the figure down to ~$13,000.
  
      </p>
       
      <p
        class="case_paragraph m-48_top media-m-24_top"
      >
        
    Importantly, we made the system more secure as we started using RabbitMQ, Memcached, Elasticsearch, and other services within our own network. The monitoring system that we kept perfecting as we went on with cutting the costs confirmed the effectiveness of cost optimization.
  
      </p>

    Costs can’t be cut overnight. Not without damaging user experience, service uptime, and system survivability, anyway. We initially told Veeqo how we would decrease monthly infrastructure costs by ~7,000 dollars, but it took months to make smooth transitions. Our Veeqo partners trusted our professionalism, and it all paid off. We’re proud of how we optimized the costs along with improving the system’s performance.

    Phase 6: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  
      </h2>
       
      <p
        class="case_paragraph m-24_bottom"
      >
        
    IaC is a way to manage large structures where manual operation is highly ineffective or simply impossible. To go fully IaC, our teams made fundamental changes in the ways we develop, deliver, and maintain our solutions.
  
      </p>
       
      <h4
        class="case_title_h4 m-12_bottom"
      >
        
    Advantages of IaC
  
      </h4>
       
      <ol>
        <li>
          
      Control over resources: The more people have access to the cloud, the more expensive it is to use it. By introducing IaC, we rule out disorderly alterations in the system and prevent wastefulness, thus improving security and gaining firmer control over resources and costs.
    
        </li>
         
        <li>
          
      Reproducibility: IaC is the tool of ultimate reproducibility. By going straight to Terraform, one can avoid repetitive manual work, thus achieving: lower operating costs, higher speed, better coordination within the team, (ideally) fully automated infrastructure deployment.
    
        </li>
         
        <li>
          
      Security: Introduced changes can be tracked, reviewed, and analyzed automatically before delivery. It’s a reliable way to detect and fix vulnerabilities before they can make trouble.
    
        </li>
         
        <li>
          
      Reliable documentation: Documentation effectively stops being relevant once a new change is introduced into the system without being documented. With many changes going on, doc updates get easily forgotten. But if you have code for documentation, this problem is solved. There’s nothing more relevant for understanding a system than code itself. Ideally, what you have in master is what you have in production.
    
        </li>
      </ol>
