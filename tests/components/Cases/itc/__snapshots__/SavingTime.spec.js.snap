    Instead of filling out hundreds of pages of the paper-based manual, R4TCA coaches can focus on the aspects of their work that truly add value to stakeholders, i.e. coaching and collaborating with SMEs. Running a digital manual is also more convenient to report progress and derive automatic statistics.

    I had concerns that coaches would find it difficult to deal with a digital instrument and that they would be reluctant to switch to it. However, the web app is so user-friendly and intuitive that the coaches got the hang of it easily.

    To help the coaches get the hang of the web application, we also prepared a user manual to guide users through the applicationâ€™s functionality. The guide features screenshots from the digital manual to make learning easier.
