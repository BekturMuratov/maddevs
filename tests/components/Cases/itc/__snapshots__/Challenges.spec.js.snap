      The main challenge for ITC was to coordinate missions and formalise recommendations provided by the coaches. Initially, the project was using a paper-based manual cum mission report to track their activities with SMEs. R4TCA implementers saw digitalisation as a major opportunity for improvement.

      The web application we developed is now ITCâ€™s reliable tool for coordinating EMCI. Both SMEs and coaches track their activities in electronic form, generating valuable data that is analysed and disseminated quickly and conveniently. ITC can monitor mission progress. Planning and implementing the project and missions became significantly easier and faster.

      Going paperless is an internationally recognised way to make your operations greener and more sustainable. The  digital tool is a long-term solution that can help prevent the extensive use of paper in future projects, too.

      We at ITC could benefit from digital transformation. The paper-based manual was 200 pages long, and the coach needed to fill out two copies of it every time. Developing a web app to deal with it was a solution that had lots of pluses and not a single minus.
