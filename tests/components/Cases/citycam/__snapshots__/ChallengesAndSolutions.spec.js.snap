      The project’s two main ambitions were low energy use and high load capacity. To pursue the former, we engineered
      a device that could take photos and send them to the server every three seconds while using under one watt of
      electricity. A high-load service we were simultaneously building, in turn, needed to save and transmit images to
      the user app and the customer’s website. The general flow of the system went like this:
