    If traffic is poorly organised, virtually any process in a modern city’s life can come to a halt. Around the
    world, the most advanced technologies are applied to urban traffic to make sure that hundreds of thousands of
    people and vehicles moving around simultaneously can do it safely and efficiently.

    Traffic cameras are one of the solutions that allow making better transportation decisions in real time. If you
    can monitor roads and intersections, you can plan itineraries optimally, whether you’re just a resident driving
    around or an official in charge of traffic management. Consider the benefits of traffic cameras for three
    potential categories of users.

          They can check what’s happening on major crossroads (or those they’re planning to include in their routes) before even getting in the car for their drive home, to work, or elsewhere. It’s convenient, and it can save residents time and money.

          They can see how many and how often potential customers drive past their store/eatery/salon and how the supplies they need make it to them through the city. All this helps devise better business models in terms of both marketing and logistics.

        They can identify weaknesses in the way traffic is currently organised by statistically analysing what
        crossroads and road sections get clogged frequently. Adjustments, like making certain green lights last
        longer, can solve congestion problems.

    Providing these benefits takes cutting-edge technological solutions. The cameras need to require minimum energy
    supply and function continuously without frequent external inputs. It was a serious challenge to build them that
    way.
