        Initially, it was decided to create a movie library with previews, duration information, etc. Purchasing
        videos was the easiest part. Pulling a good description for each movie from an external source eliminated the
        routine work related to content management. To address this issue.

        To provide viewers with access to their favourite TV channels, the platform needed to emulate the TV

        Yourcast.tv.

        Yourcast.tv by Mad Devs is used to create TV-like streams using YouTube video content. All you need is to
        create a list of YouTube videos that you want to stream. The streaming starts a few seconds after you save
        your list of videos.

        The customer purchased access to several popular TV channels streamed online, and Mad Devs added additional
        code to start re-streaming the channels using Yourcast.TV. As a result, the platform’s viewers received a
        selection of TV channel streams on their devices. HBO, Showtime and other TV channels were seamlessly added to
        the list of available options.

        Technically, Django was used for storing stream entries for the Live TV service. The admin created the entries

        To reduce traffic while re-streaming movies and TV series, Mad Devs used Nimble Streamer and Nimble
        Transcoder. As the source provided maximum quality, re-streaming of the ‘heavy’ content was overly expensive.
        To maintain high quality while reducing costs, files were split into data packages by Nimble Streamer and sent
        to the viewer’s browser.

        As all parts of the projects were developed independently during the first two phases, Mad Devs redesigned the
        platform infrastructure to orchestrate all of its services. The project became more organised and
        cost-effective, which was important for further growth.

        Video on Demand (VoD) functionality was added to the platform in 2019. To adapt it to the most current VoD
        standards, Mad Devs leveraged Nimble Streamer and Nimble Transcoder. The viewers received access to the
        present-day VoD experience, enabling on-the-go movie ordering and MD5 hotlink protection.

        In 2020, the platform launched individual user authorisation through email. With the statistics collected for

        The development of the platform is still a work in progress. The Mad Devs team improves it with each new
        iteration and borrows best practices from leading over-the-top (OTT) providers to make end users happier. The
        project is progressing towards a modern entertainment platform.

        The platform will remain the one-and-only NDA-protected project. However, Yourcast.TV is fully open source and
        can serve as a foundation for other video streaming services, assuming monetisation through subscription or
        advertising. With the experience Mad Devs gained building the platform, customers from the video streaming
        industry will be able to orchestrate back-end technologies of any complexity.
