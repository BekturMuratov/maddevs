    Video on Demand (VoD) functionality was added to the platform in 2019. To adapt it to the most current VoD
    standards, Mad Devs leveraged Nimble Streamer and Nimble Transcoder. The viewers received access to the
    present-day VoD experience, enabling on-the-go movie ordering and MD5 hotlink protection.
