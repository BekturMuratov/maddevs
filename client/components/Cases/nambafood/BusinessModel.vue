        Namba Food API
      </h3>
      <TextParagraph>
        Namba Food API allows businesses to integrate the API into any mobile payment application. As a result,
        end-users can quickly order goods and services without leaving the app using the appâ€™s own payment system. Such
        API benefits businesses because end users use the payment method defined by the mobile app. At the moment, Mbank
        by Commercial Bank Kyrgyzstan and Balance by Beeline, a telecommunication service provider, have successfully
        integrated Namba Food API into their mobile apps.
