        Code of exceptional quality has been our primary goal in our work with Clutch.co. By meticulously testing each
        code element with unit, acceptance, and screen compare tests and by applying present-day approaches to
        development and deployment, we have provided exceptional flexibility in our delivery of a stable Clutch.co
        solution. To avoid downtimes and issues caused by new deployments, testing and staging environments in
        Kubernetes perfectly mimic production. Thus, all updates are made without any inconvenience to the end users.

        A business always strives to effectively use their employeesâ€™ time and skills, even when they are 12 hours away.
        On top of the typical Slack communication, due to the social isolation required by the global pandemic, the Mad
        Devs team integrated online meetings to mimic a normal office setup.
