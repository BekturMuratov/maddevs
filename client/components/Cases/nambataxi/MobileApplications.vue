        We developed mobile applications that can handle the full range of functions a taxi service needs. Passengers,
        drivers, and operators interact through a thoroughly automated environment. Passengers order a cab with just a
        few taps, drivers can accept orders within seconds, and all journeys can be tracked in real time.

        Ariadna: Data geocoder
      </h3>
      <TextParagraph class="m-48_bottom media-m-24_bottom">
        Ariadna is an in-house developed, open-source geocoder based on ElasticSearch that uses OpenStreetMap. The tool
        searches for coordinates using the names of places and synonyms. It can find crossroads and addresses within a
        certain radius. It does reverse geocoding and updates automatically as it receives new data from drivers.

        One of the most challenging things in the project was to enable human-friendly search on the map. Ariadna was a
        unique solution that handled the task.

        The result was a complex yet reliable system. It features six roles (Operator, Passenger, Partner, Driver,
        Manager, and Corporate Client), and hereâ€™s how interactions among apps and third-party software go:
