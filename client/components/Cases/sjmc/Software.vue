        Since the available existing solutions had limitations and restrictions, The Sir John Monash Centre hired an
        Australia-based IT company to create an integrated multimedia solution to coordinate and communicate with
        every piece of technology in the centre.

        The MMIT Brain synchronises two information systems: the multimedia management system and the smart building
        management system. The multimedia software and hardware management system controls, supervises and monitors
        lighting, audio, video and special effects for the SJMC. The universal software infrastructure to building
        controls infrastructure integrators is the third-party framework that works as a foundation of the SJMC
        intelligent building. It supports a complete IP-based information network for real-time management and
        controls the SJMC's multiple facilities. This one-stop software manages all building operations, energy,
        security, and operational systems.
