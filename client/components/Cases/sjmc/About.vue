      There is much to learn from the Great War, however, ordinary history books often only explain events on a
      surface level. In contrast, using interactive multimedia installations and technologies, the 480-square metre
      interpretive centre takes visitors on a journey in the footsteps of ordinary soldiers who experienced
      extraordinary events.

      The SJMC’s technology enables each visitor to personalise their experience as they learn about the Australian
      soldiers’ stories. Visitors are "fully immersed" in a way that is not seen anywhere else.
