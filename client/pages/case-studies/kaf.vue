          A custom video streaming solution* was created to provide the ultimate entertainment experience to isolated
          groups of people feeling homesick. Access and the ability to securely watch familiar and up-to-date content on
          any device is something that closely resembles home and its comforts.

        <TextParagraph class="m-24_bottom">
          Initially, it was decided to create a movie library with previews, duration information, etc. Purchasing
          videos was the easiest part. Pulling a good description for each movie from an external source eliminated the
          routine work related to content management. To address this issue.

          To provide viewers with access to their favourite TV channels, the platform needed to emulate the TV
          experience. To add live-streaming technology, Mad Devs leveraged its existing open-source project,
          Yourcast.tv.

          Yourcast.tv by Mad Devs is used to create TV-like streams using YouTube video content. All you need is to
          create a list of YouTube videos that you want to stream. The streaming starts a few seconds after you save
          your list of videos.

          The customer purchased access to several popular TV channels streamed online, and Mad Devs added additional
          code to start re-streaming the channels using Yourcast.TV. As a result, the platform’s viewers received a
          selection of TV channel streams on their devices. HBO, Showtime and other TV channels were seamlessly added to
          the list of available options.

          Technically, Django was used for storing stream entries for the Live TV service. The admin created the entries

        <TextParagraph class="m-24_bottom media-m-12_bottom">
          To reduce traffic while re-streaming movies and TV series, Mad Devs used Nimble Streamer and Nimble
          Transcoder. As the source provided maximum quality, re-streaming of the ‘heavy’ content was overly expensive.
          To maintain high quality while reducing costs, files were split into data packages by Nimble Streamer and sent
          to the viewer’s browser.
        </TextParagraph>
        <TextParagraph class="m-48_bottom media-m-24_bottom">
          As all parts of the projects were developed independently during the first two phases, Mad Devs redesigned the
          platform infrastructure to orchestrate all of its services. The project became more organised and
          cost-effective, which was important for further growth.

          Video on Demand (VoD) functionality was added to the platform in 2019. To adapt it to the most current VoD

          present-day VoD experience, enabling on-the-go movie ordering and MD5 hotlink protection.

          In 2020, the platform launched individual user authorisation through email. With the statistics collected for

          number of new features were added to improve the existing services:

          The development of the platform is still a work in progress. The Mad Devs team improves it with each new

          The platform will remain the one-and-only NDA-protected project. However, Yourcast.TV is fully open source and
          can serve as a foundation for other video streaming services, assuming monetisation through subscription or
          advertising. With the experience Mad Devs gained building the platform, customers from the video streaming
          industry will be able to orchestrate back-end technologies of any complexity.

          While working on this project, we acquired extensive hands-on experience in building modern livestreaming and VoD services. We were amazed by the abundance of open-source tools available for building great OTT platforms and online movies. Yourcast.TV was the beginning; however, we now see that this internal project could become a cornerstone for many enterprise-level solutions.
